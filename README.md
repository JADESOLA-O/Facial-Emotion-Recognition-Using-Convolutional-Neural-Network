# Facial-Emotion-Recognition-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Network
Facial emotion recognition systems are versatile tools that can be adapted to a wide range of industries. In healthcare, FER can be integrated into monitoring systems to assess patientsâ€™ emotional states, which is particularly useful for mental health applications where real-time monitoring can alert caregivers to early signs of distress. Customer analytics in retail environments can utilize FER to gauge customer satisfaction, providing insights for tailored customer service. In security, FER can analyze behaviours in real-time, potentially flagging suspicious activities based on unusual emotional states. This adaptability makes FER a valuable asset in various sectors.

The primary goal is to train three models, identify the best-performing CNN model for real-time facial emotion recognition and integrate the model with the best evaluation score into a streamlit web application.
The secondary goals of the project are to design a system that excels in training unseen and real-world data, ensuring its practical usefulness. The project also aims to construct an efficient system directly employed in real-time applications.
